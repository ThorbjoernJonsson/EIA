Programs to get data from the EIA webpage

These files are to get data from EIA, both through the API (for historical data) and through EIA's CSV files (for live data from the Weekly Petroleum Status Reports). In order to be able to use the EIA API you need to get an API key on https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php.
